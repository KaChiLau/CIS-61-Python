The diameter of a circle is twice the radius, and the area is found by squaring the radius then multiplying by the irrational number, π.

What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 10? Use 3.14159 for π.

Use Python as a calculator to find the answer; paste the expression and the answer into the Notes."""
