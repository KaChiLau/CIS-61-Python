y is given as 3 times x squared, plus 6 times x,plus 9.
What is the value of y when x equals 333?

A Quadratic Formula: y = ax^2 + bx + c

                     y = 3x^2 + 6x + 9

Calculate y in python and paste the experssion and the answer in the notes."""

"""x = int(input("Please input the x: "))"""

x = 333

""" print("y = ", 3 * x ** 2 + 6 * x + 9)"""

poly1 = x ** 2

print("y = ", 3 * poly1 + 6 * x + 9)
